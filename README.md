Readme:

This project will allow you to play ink files in a simulated terminal. 
In addition to this I've also setup a pipeline to deploy to GitHub pages . 



So this project is just me getting my feet wet with Godot. 
It's open source(MIT) , and already setup to automatically deploy to a GitHub pages site.
