Playable here

This is VERY rough right now, while the basic functionality is there,  many things aren't. 
This project will allow you to play ink files in a simulated terminal. 
In addition to this I've also setup a pipeline to deploy to GitHub pages, this doesn't work for some reason. 
If you can fix this , awesome. 
So this project is just me getting my feet wet with Godot. 
It's open source(MIT) , and already setup to automatically deploy to a GitHub pages site.
