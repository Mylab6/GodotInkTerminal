So here's how I became a software engineer. 

But , first guess what I majored in. 

* It was deff Comp Sci 
* No one cares what you majored in
* College is a scam

- Well, congrats, you're correct.

While I didn't study compsci formally, since I know I was dropping out at 22 or so anyway, I skipped my college classes and worked on games. 
The very first thing I made, was a beat box/noise maker called BeatQuest. I totally had no idea a decade or so later I'd be a software engineer.

This is a Godot project, but I've learned the vast majority of my programing with Unity. 


- That's it for now. 

-> END
